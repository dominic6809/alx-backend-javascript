# Unit Tests in JavaScript (0x06)

This project focuses on writing unit tests in JavaScript using **Mocha** as the testing framework. It covers essential testing principles, including the use of spies, stubs, and assertions to verify the correctness of the code.

## Key Concepts

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are automated tests that verify the correctness of individual units of code (e.g., functions, methods) in isolation. They ensure that each component of a program works as expected, and help identify bugs early in the development process.

### Back-end
The back-end refers to the server-side part of a web application, responsible for processing requests, managing data, and performing operations that are not visible to the user. It typically involves server-side technologies, APIs, and databases.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language commonly used for web development. It enables interactive elements on web pages and can run on both the client-side (browser) and server-side (Node.js).

### ES6
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to JavaScript that introduced new features such as classes, modules, arrow functions, template literals, and more, to make the language more powerful and easier to work with.

### Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is event-driven, non-blocking, and ideal for building scalable network applications.

### Express.js
Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs and web applications. It provides robust tools for routing, middleware, and request handling, making server-side development faster and more efficient.

### Mocha
Mocha is a JavaScript testing framework that provides a flexible structure for writing and running tests. It supports various assertion libraries, and it can run tests asynchronously. Mocha is commonly used with other tools like Chai for assertions and Sinon for stubbing and spying.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the importance of unit testing in JavaScript, particularly in back-end development using Node.js and Express.js. Mocha is the chosen testing framework, and various techniques like stubbing, spying, and assertions are used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the code. By following modern JavaScript practices (ES6+), developers can write clean, maintainable code and test it effectively using tools like Mocha.
