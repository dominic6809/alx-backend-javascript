## About
The purpose of this project is to familiarize developers with ES6 features and how they improve the JavaScript development process. Each concept is demonstrated with examples to help you understand its usage in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- Learn key features introduced in ES6
- Understand how to use `let`, `const`, and block-scoped variables
- Explore arrow functions and default parameters
- Work with rest and spread operators
- Learn about template literals, object creation, iterators, and `for-of` loops

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/es6-basics.git
cd es6-basics
```
  Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Install dependencies if needed (if using any Node packages).

## Usage
Each ES6 concept is explained in separate JavaScript files. Run the files using Node.js to see the output. 
Feel free to modify and experiment with the code examples to gain a deeper understanding of ES6 features.
