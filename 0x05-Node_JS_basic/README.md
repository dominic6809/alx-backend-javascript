# 0x05-Node_JS_basic
# Node.js Basics: Full Server and Database Integration

## Project Overview
This project involves building a series of small applications using Node.js, focusing on concepts such as HTTP servers, file handling, Express.js, controllers, routes, error handling, and working with CSV data. By completing this project, you will learn how to set up a server, process data asynchronously, and manage routing logic in a Node.js environment.

## Concepts Taught & Tasks Completed

### 1. **Basic HTTP Server with Node.js**
   - **Concepts**: Basic HTTP server, handling requests, and serving responses.
   - **Task**: 
     - Created an HTTP server using the `http` module.
     - The server listens on port `1245` and returns a simple message: "Hello Holberton School!".
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Setting up a Node.js HTTP server.
     - Basic response handling with HTTP methods.

### 2. **Read File Asynchronously**
   - **Concepts**: Asynchronous file handling, reading CSV files.
   - **Task**: 
     - Read student data from a CSV file asynchronously.
     - Display student names grouped by fields (e.g., CS, SWE) with error handling for empty lines.
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Asynchronous file reading using Node.js.
     - Parsing and processing CSV data.
     - Basic error handling.

### 3. **Using Express to Handle Routes**
   - **Concepts**: Express framework, routing, error handling in Express.
   - **Task**: 
     - Built an HTTP server using Express, making it easier to handle routes.
     - The server responds with a simple message and handles invalid routes with proper error messages.
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Introduction to Express.js.
     - Handling routes and managing errors with Express.

### 4. **Dynamic Student Data Handling with Express**
   - **Concepts**: Route parameters, dynamic data rendering.
   - **Task**: 
     - Built routes to return student lists dynamically based on the `CS` or `SWE` field.
     - Sorted and displayed students by field, using route parameters to filter the major.
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Handling dynamic data in Express routes.
     - Parsing URL parameters and filtering data accordingly.

### 5. **Organizing the Server with Controllers and Routes**
   - **Concepts**: MVC pattern, separation of concerns.
   - **Task**: 
     - Created controllers for different parts of the application (e.g., `AppController`, `StudentsController`).
     - Organized routes separately in a `routes` directory and linked them to controllers.
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
     - Separating logic into controllers for better maintainability.

### 6. **Read Database Function and Error Handling**
   - **Concepts**: Asynchronous operations, promises, error handling.
   - **Task**: 
     - Implemented the `readDatabase` function to read and parse student data from a CSV file asynchronously.
     - Handled errors such as inaccessible files or invalid CSV formats.
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Using promises to handle asynchronous code.
     - Error handling in asynchronous functions.

### 7. **Express Server with Controllers and Dynamic Routing**
   - **Concepts**: Dynamic routing, passing parameters to controllers, data handling.
   - **Task**: 
     - Created routes for the homepage (`/`) and dynamic routes (`/students/:major`).
     - Used controllers to return student data dynamically based on the major parameter (`CS`, `SWE`).
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Dynamic route handling in Express.
     - Handling different request types and returning appropriate data.

### 8. **Setting Up a Full Server with Babel and Nodemon**
   - **Concepts**: ES6 features, Babel, Nodemon for development.
   - **Task**: 
     - Set up the development environment to use ES6 features (e.g., `import`, `export`) with Babel.
     - Used Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Configuring Babel for ES6 syntax in Node.js.
     - Using Nodemon to speed up development by automatically restarting the server.

### 9. **Final Server Setup and Integration**
   - **Concepts**: Full server architecture, integration of all components.
   - **Task**: 
     - Integrated the entire application, linking controllers, routes, and the server setup.
     - Ensured the application handles dynamic requests, serves student data, and provides proper error messages when necessary.
   - **Skills Learned**:
     - Full-stack integration in a Node.js server.
     - Handling various request types and dynamic responses.

## Dependencies
    Express
    Nodemon
    Babel (for ES6 support)
## Future Enhancements
    Add more robust validation for CSV file format.
    Implement authentication for certain routes.
