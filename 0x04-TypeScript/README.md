# 0x04. TypeScript

This project serves as a comprehensive learning module for TypeScript, covering various concepts and implementations related to education management, interfaces, classes, and type definitions.

## Project Structure

- **task_0/**: Contains basic TypeScript implementations with configuration files and a simple table rendering feature.
- **task_1/**: Implements interfaces for teachers and directors, along with class definitions and functions.
- **task_2/**: Features interfaces and classes for employee management, including function type predicates and union types.
- **task_3/**: Demonstrates the use of ambient declarations, CRUD operations, and interface/type declarations for row elements.
- **task_4/**: Expands on subjects, teachers, and declaration merging with specialized subject classes for C++, Java, and React.
- **task_5/**: Introduces interfaces for major and minor credits, along with functions to calculate total credits.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Basic Types**: Understanding and using TypeScript's basic types.
2. **Interfaces**: Creating and using interfaces to define structures for data.
3. **Classes**: Implementing classes with methods and constructors.
4. **Namespaces**: Organizing code into namespaces for better modularization.
5. **Declaration Merging**: Extending interfaces with additional properties.
6. **Ambient Declarations**: Using third-party libraries with ambient declarations for type safety.
7. **Type Predicates**: Utilizing functions that act as type guards.
8. **Literal Types**: Defining string literal types for more constrained variable values.
9. **Function Overloading**: Creating functions that can handle different types of arguments and return values.
